/**
 * Tiling Problem
 * Let “count(n)” be the count of ways to place tiles on a “2 x n” grid, we have following two ways to place first tile.
 * 1) If we place first tile vertically, the problem reduces to “count(n-1)”
 * 2) If we place first tile horizontally, we have to place second tile also horizontally. So the problem reduces to “count(n-2)”
